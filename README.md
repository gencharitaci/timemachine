# Mecklenburg County Time Machine

Mecklenburg County's Time Machine is a public-facing raster imagery viewer, built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). The development and build environment is [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Architecture

![Architecture](./Architecture.png)

Time machine can draw any `z/x/y` raster tiles.

Time Machine defines aerials in `src/assets/surveys.json` and overlay layers in `src/assets/overlays.js`. If you are a NearMap customer with an api key, you can create a `.env` file in the root project folder and create a variable like this:

```.env
VITE_NEARTOKEN=your_key
```

Surveys from NearMap will be integrated with your own aerials defined in `src/assets/surveys.json`.
